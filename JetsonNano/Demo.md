# Using colab with Jetson Nano

Refer to the [colab notebook](https://github.com/kaustubh-sadekar/Colab-Notebooks/blob/master/JetsonNano/CIFAR10_Practice.ipynb) used for this tutorial.
And the code to be run in Jetson Nano can be refered [here](https://github.com/kaustubh-sadekar/Colab-Notebooks/blob/master/JetsonNano/code1.py)

### Steps to be followed
1. Run the [colab notebook](https://github.com/kaustubh-sadekar/Colab-Notebooks/blob/master/JetsonNano/CIFAR10_Practice.ipynb) to train your model.
2. Download the saved model to your Jetson Nano in the folder where the [code file](https://github.com/kaustubh-sadekar/Colab-Notebooks/blob/master/JetsonNano/code1.py) is saved.
3. Run `python3 code1.py` to perform inference using your Jetson Nano with the trained model.
